# War The Card Game
[You can play the game here!](http://warthecardgame.surge.sh/)
## Game Logic 
#### The user can pick how many players are in each game
#### A deck of cards is shuffled, and then split between the number of players selected
#### the players each flip over a card, the player with the highest number wins that round
#### in the event of a tie, then it is war, each player places 3 cards facedown, an flips the fourth card to be compared. The player with the highest card then wins the war. 
#### the same mechanisms go on until one player has all the cards, the player with all of the cards is the winner
